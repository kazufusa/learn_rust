# Learn-Rust Repository

Welcome to my Learn-Rust repository! This is a space where I document my journey of learning Rust, a systems programming language that emphasizes safety, speed, and concurrency. Each project in this repository represents a step forward in my understanding and mastery Rust.

# Projects

Each project focuses on a different aspect of Rust, gradually increasing in complexity and scope. Here's an overview of the projects currentry in this repository:

- **Hello World**
  - **Description**: A simple program that prints "Hello World!" to the console. This project serves as my introducion to Rust's syntax and compiler
  - **Link**: [rust_hello_world_1](./rust_helloworld_1/)

# Learnig Goals

This repository is not just a collection of projects; it's a reflection of my learning process. Here are some of the key areas I aim to explore:

- Rust's ownwership and borrowing mechanisms
- Concurrency in Rust
- Web development with Rust

# How to Navigate

Each project directory contains a `README.md` with an overview of the project, learning outcomes, and reflections. Feel free to explore each project to see my progress and the specific concepts I've tackled.

# Refrections and Future Plans

Documenting my journey through Rust has been incredibly rewarding. I've already learned so much, and I'm excited to continue exploring more complex topics and projects. This repository will continue to grow as my knowledge expands, so stay tuned for updates.
